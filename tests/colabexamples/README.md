This directly contains similar examples with slightly different styles. 

   - [test_mean_reversion_attacker.py](https://github.com/microprediction/midone/blob/main/tests/colabexamples/test_mean_reversion_attacker.py) uses dictionary state
   - [test_mean_reversion_attacker_dataclasses.py](https://github.com/microprediction/midone/blob/main/tests/colabexamples/test_mean_reversion_attacker_dataclasses.py) uses dataclasses
   - [test_mean_reversion_attacker_flat.py](https://github.com/microprediction/midone/blob/main/tests/colabexamples/test_mean_reversion_attacker_flat.py) flattens state and params
   - [test_mean_reversion_attacker_named_tuples.py](https://github.com/microprediction/midone/blob/main/tests/colabexamples/test_mean_reversion_attacker_named_tuples.py) uses named tuples

These were prepared for a Linked-In poll. Plain dicts won. Sorry to those who didn't vote for them.
